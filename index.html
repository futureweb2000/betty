						<h4>Office Cleaning</h4>
					</article>
					
					<article class="service-description">
						An office building cleaning service allows the employees of an office to concentrate on their work. Some offices assign cleaning tasks to employees and that takes away from productive time spent doing work and with clients.  An office has the option of hiring an office cleaning service for daily work or weekly cleaning visits. It all depends upon the needs and preferences of an office.
